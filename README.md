## About me

Who am I?

Hello! My name is Arthur Lewis and I'm a software engineer from Pennington, NJ.

Why do I code?

When I was 14 years old, I took a computer programming course writing basic code in Python. Ever since then I've known I want to pursue a career in software engineering.

What are my qualifications?

I started off mostly self taught by reading books, watching tutorials, and exploring online. 
I made and shared basic games and programs in Java with friends and family. 
In highschool, I designed a Java program for my history class that added a bibliography and footnotes given the teachers specific requirements (modified version of APA). 
After starting college I switched my attention to web development following an internship as a Software Engineer for Gearbrain. 
Since then I've been mostly coding in JavaScript with a focus on Full-stack web development. 
In May 2023, I graduated from Lehigh University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Business and a Minor in Data Science.

What have I been doing recently?

Since graduating from Lehigh, I've been working on personal projects such as Palette Hub, showcasing my skills and abilities as a software engineer. I'm currently looking for a full time position ideally near NYC, although I'm open to relocating if necessary.
