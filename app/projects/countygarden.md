County Garden is a MySQL Relational Database for an insurance company, County Garden. This was a college project for the class "Database Systems, Algorithms, and Applications".

- Design the ER Diagram and create the tables.
- Code the command line interface for cusomters, agents, and adjusters.
- Setup the MySQL Server on a Docker container.

### Data Generation

I used [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) to generate most of my data while doing some manual entry.

### User Interface

My interface uses menus to allow the user to navigate the data, when viewing any particular piece of data options will appear at the bottom for further navigation.
For example when on the customer view you can either view all customers, view a single customer, or return to the select interface menu.
You can switch between those menus using the assigned numbers given.
For each menu there is a back selection at the bottom which allows the user to return the last menu until they return to the select interface menu where they can then quit the program.
