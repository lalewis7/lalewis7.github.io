[Palette Hub](https://palettehub.net) is a social media site for sharing palettes of hex code colors. Users can create, browse, and share palettes, as well as engage with them through “likes”.

The purpose of Palette Hub is to showcase a full stack website including Database Management, Backend REST API, Frontend Website, and Container Orchestration. I diversified the stack to exhibit a wide range of skills. The stack includes a MySQL Database, Spring Boot REST API, React website, Nginx web server, and Docker Compose container orchestration.
