Hi there! My name is Arthur Lewis, and I am a creative, dynamic, and meticulous full-stack software engineer with a passion for facilitating positive change through my work.

I hold an integrated degree in computer science and business with a minor in data science from Lehigh University â€” however, my expertise and enthusiasm for technology extends far past my undergraduate education. I&rsquo;ve been creating programs that entertain, educate, and, maybe, make life a little easier since I was 14 years old.

My interest and expertise is in building full stack websites, from the frontend user interface and experience to the backend business logic, database design, and infrastructure.

I am looking to contribute my skills to a team of other technology enthusiasts who are committed to solving problems. If you're interested in chatting about software engineering or how I might contribute to your technology needs, email me at [l.arthur.lewis7@gmail.com](mailto:l.arthur.lewis7@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-lewis/).
