                Hi there! My name is Arthur Lewis, and I am a creative, dynamic, and meticulous full-stack software engineer with a passion for facilitating positive change through my work.
                </p>
                <p>
                I hold an integrated degree in computer science and business with a minor in data science from Lehigh University â€” however, my expertise and enthusiasm for technology extends far past my undergraduate education. I&rsquo;ve been creating programs that entertain, educate, and, maybe, make life a little easier since I was 14 years old.
                </p>
                <p>
                My interest and expertise is in building full stack websites, from the frontend user interface and experience to the backend business logic, database design, and infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                I am looking to contribute my skills to a team of other technology enthusiasts who are committed to solving problems. If you're interested in chatting about software engineering or how I might contribute to your technology needs,
