For my senior capstone at Lehigh University I worked with a small team to continue development on a search portal for the non-profit [AEquitas](https://aequitasresource.org/). AEquitas is a nonprofit organization focused on developing, evaluating, and refining prosecution practices related to gender-based violence and human trafficking. During development, I posted some [medium blogs](https://medium.com/@arthur.lewis/list/senior-capstone-4a02774080f3) documenting my problem solving approach to obstacles I ran into during development.

### ‚ùì The Problem

Prior to AEquitas docs, AEquitas was using Dropbox to store their legal corpus. The drawback with this approach is that when the AEquitas team was building a case, they were limited to the Dropbox keyword search for finding documents.

### üí° The Solution

The solution was to create a more sophisticated search portal that the AEquitas team could use to lookup documents in their corpus. Using Apache Solr, AWS, and Vue.js my team created a search web app that let the AEquitas team upload, delete, and search for documents. During our development I designed the infrastructure using AWS API Gateway, Lambda Functions, EC2 instances 

### üèÜ My Contributions

- Designed the architecture for the backend of the website using Apache Solr in tangent with multiple AWS services including API gateway, Lambda Functions, S3, EC2, Route 53, and CloudFront.
- Constructed a development and pre-production environment. Tested set up and python code functionality of Lambda Functions before being delivered. Initial client feedback was positive.
- Secured both the development and production website using a master password.
- Delivered weekly sprint reports in an Agile environment. Directed weekly progress meetings with the sponsor to answer questions and give status updates.
