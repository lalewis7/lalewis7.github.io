## Overview

This project was for the class Software Engineering, which was meant to mock an agile work environment. Team members took turns working on different aspects of the project each sprint. The roles included:

- Project Manager
- Web Developer
- Backend Engineer
- Mobile Developer
- Admin CLI Developer

## ðŸ¥ž The Stack

The project manager was responsible for checking in on other team members as well as setting up the Heroku environment. Bash scripts were setup to deploy changes directly to Heroku.

### Mobile App

The mobile app used the Flutter framework.

### Web

The React website was written in TypeScript, styled with Bootstrap, and built with webpack.

### Admin CLI

The Java admin CLI gave the administrators of the website direct access to the data bypassing the REST API by connecting directly to the PostgreSQL database.

### Backend

The REST API Backend used the Java Spark framework.

#### Database Tables

- `messages(message_id, msg, post_time, user_id)`
- `upvotes(message_id, user_id)`
- `downvotes(message_id, user_id)`
- `users(user_id, username, bio, email, join_date)`
- `comments(comment_id, comment, post_time, message_id, user_id)`
